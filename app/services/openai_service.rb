         We're looking for specific info related to '#{artist}'. I want you to find:
         - A short bio for the artist.
         - Their official website, prioritizing .com domains with clear artist branding.
         - Their Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud links.
          - Use search terms like '[artist name] official site' and return verified results only â€” avoid fan pages or third-party profiles.
          The object returned will look like:
          {
          name: (artist name)
          bio: (artist bio)
          home_url: (homepage)
          sc_url: (soundcloud)
          am_url: (apple music)
